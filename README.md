# Can I Eat It? (Web)

## What is this?
This is my 2nd project for the [100 Days of Code](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code) challenge.
I was hiking w/ my friend Vicky one day (I think it might've been one of the more unpleasant ones) when she jokingly said I should create an app called "Can I Eat It?" that would allow you to take a picture of e.g. a plant, which the app would then tell you if it's edible or not. I hadn't touched mobile apps since my last job and had no intention of ever going back, so I just laughed it off. While thinking of what I could do for a second project, this idea came back, and I grabbed it because why not try doing a suuper basic version of that on the web (which I have fresher experience w/)? And even if I can't get it to tell you if something's edible or not (I'm banking on their being a publicly accessible database of plants that include their edibility...), I'll at least get to figure out how to bootstrap a web app w/ Reactjs and all those other crazy necessary additions w/o the lead developer at work laying the groundwork for me. :P
